# 🎉 Getting Started

To install the template from NuGet.org run the following command:

```bash
dotnet new install SSW.VerticalSliceArchitecture.Template
```

Then create a new solution:

```bash
mkdir Sprout
cd Sprout

dotnet new ssw-vsa
```

Finally, to update the template to the latest version run:

```bash
dotnet new update
```

# 📚 Faster Development

To speed up development there is a `dotnet new` template to create a full Vertical Slice.

```bash
dotnet new ssw-vsa-slice -f Student
```
`-f` or `--feature` where the feature name is the **singular** name of the feature.

Of course, there are always exceptions where appending an 's' is not enough. For example, `Person` becomes `People` and `Child` becomes `Children`.

For this, use the optional parameter:

```bash
dotnet new ssw-vsa-slice -f Person -fp People
```

optional: `-fp` or `--feature-plural` where the feature name is the **plural** name of the feature.

This creates everything you need to get started with a new feature.

- Full CRUD endpoints
- CQRS 
    - missing `EventHandlers/` folder as this is more uncommon
    - provides `Events/` as a folder to demonstrate how to trigger side effects
- Basic REPR pattern (i.e., Request, an Endpoint, and a Response)
- Adds a new Entity
- Basic DDD pattern - the 'Complete' method on the entity shows adding Domain events and using `Result` objects instead of exceptions for validation
- Adds a DbSet to the DbContext
- Adds EF Core Entity Type Configuration
- Adds a Repository

While there is a small amount of code to remove, it is better to push you towards the pit of success, than allow inconsistency.
