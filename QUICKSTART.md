# FastEndpoints Quick Start Guide

## Overview

FastEndpoints has been successfully integrated into the project. This guide will help you quickly understand and use the new implementation.

## What's Changed?

### âœ… Nothing Breaking!
All existing Minimal API endpoints continue to work. FastEndpoints are **additional** endpoints running side-by-side.

### âœ¨ What's New?
- New FastEndpoints-based Heroes endpoints at `/api/heroes/*`
- FastEndpoints processors replacing MediatR behaviors
- Event publishing to both MediatR and FastEndpoints event buses

## Quick Examples

### Example 1: Get All Heroes

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/heroes`

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/heroes
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "3fa85f64-5717-4562-b3fc-2c963f66afa6",
    "name": "Superman",
    "alias": "Clark Kent",
    "powerLevel": 200,
    "powers": [
      { "name": "Flight", "powerLevel": 100 },
      { "name": "Super Strength", "powerLevel": 100 }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Example 2: Create a Hero

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/heroes`

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/heroes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Wonder Woman",
    "alias": "Diana Prince",
    "powers": [
      { "name": "Super Strength", "powerLevel": 95 },
      { "name": "Flight", "powerLevel": 90 }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id": "8b3a9c7d-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678"
}
```

### Example 3: Update a Hero

**Endpoint:** `PUT /api/heroes/{heroId}`

```bash
curl -X PUT http://localhost:5000/api/heroes/8b3a9c7d-1234-5678-9abc-def012345678 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Wonder Woman",
    "alias": "Diana Prince",
    "powers": [
      { "name": "Super Strength", "powerLevel": 100 },
      { "name": "Flight", "powerLevel": 95 },
      { "name": "Lasso of Truth", "powerLevel": 85 }
    ]
  }'
```

**Response:**
```
204 No Content
```

## Validation Example

If validation fails, you'll get a 400 Bad Request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/heroes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "",
    "alias": "Diana Prince",
    "powers": []
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "code": "Name",
      "description": "'Name' must not be empty."
    }
  ]
}
```

## Swagger/OpenAPI

Access the Swagger UI at: `http://localhost:5000/scalar/v1`

You'll see:
- All existing Minimal API endpoints
- New FastEndpoints with full documentation
- Try it out functionality for all endpoints

## How It Works

### Architecture Flow

```
Your Request
    â†“
FastEndpoints Middleware
    â†“
Logging Processor (logs request + user)
    â†“
Performance Processor (starts timer)
    â†“
Validation (FluentValidation)
    â†“
Endpoint Handler (your business logic)
    â†“
Domain Events Queued
    â†“
Response Sent to Client
    â†“
Performance Processor (logs if >500ms)
    â†“
EventualConsistencyMiddleware
    â†“
Events Published (MediatR + FastEndpoints)
    â†“
Event Handlers Execute
```

### Key Components

1. **Endpoints** - Handle HTTP requests
   - `GetAllHeroesFastEndpoint` - Query endpoint
   - `CreateHeroFastEndpoint` - Command endpoint
   - `UpdateHeroFastEndpoint` - Command endpoint

2. **Processors** - Cross-cutting concerns
   - `LoggingPreProcessor` - Logs all requests
   - `PerformancePreProcessor/PostProcessor` - Tracks slow requests
   - `UnhandledExceptionHandler` - Handles exceptions

3. **Event Publishing** - Domain events
   - `IFastEndpointEventPublisher` - Queues events
   - `EventualConsistencyMiddleware` - Publishes after response
   - `PowerLevelUpdatedFastEventHandler` - Handles events

## Logging

All requests are logged with:
- Request name
- User ID (if authenticated)
- Request payload
- Execution time (if >500ms)
- Any exceptions

Example log output:
```
[Information] WebApi Request: CreateHeroFastEndpoint.Request @UserId="user123" @Request={...}
[Warning] WebApi Long Running Request: CreateHeroFastEndpoint.Request (523 milliseconds) @UserId="user123" @Request={...}
```

## Event Publishing

When you create or update a hero:

1. Domain event `PowerLevelUpdatedEvent` is raised
2. Event is queued to `HttpContext.Items`
3. Response is sent to client
4. `EventualConsistencyMiddleware` publishes event
5. Both MediatR and FastEndpoints handlers are triggered
6. Team power level is recalculated (if hero is on a team)

## Comparing Implementations

### Minimal API (MediatR) - Still Available
```
POST /api/heroes
  â†’ MediatR Command
  â†’ Handler executes
  â†’ Events auto-queued by interceptor
```

### FastEndpoints - New
```
POST /api/heroes
  â†’ FastEndpoints Endpoint
  â†’ Handler executes directly
  â†’ Events manually queued
```

Both produce identical responses and behavior!

## Testing

### Integration Tests
All existing integration tests continue to work. No changes needed.

### Manual Testing
1. Start the application: `dotnet run`
2. Open Swagger UI: `http://localhost:5000/scalar/v1`
3. Try the endpoints
4. Check logs for request logging and performance tracking

### cURL Examples
See examples above or check the documentation files for more.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Route already exists"
**Solution:** Both Minimal API and FastEndpoints use `/api/heroes`. This is intentional for demonstration. In production, use different route prefixes.

### Issue: "Validation doesn't work"
**Solution:** Ensure the request has `Content-Type: application/json` header.

### Issue: "Events not publishing"
**Solution:** Check that `EventualConsistencyMiddleware` is registered after `UseFastEndpoints()` in `Program.cs`.

## Performance

FastEndpoints is generally faster than MediatR because:
- No reflection-based handler discovery
- Direct endpoint execution
- Compile-time route binding

Expect similar or better performance compared to Minimal API endpoints.

## Next Steps

1. **Try It Out**
   - Build and run the application
   - Test the endpoints
   - Check the logs

2. **Read Documentation**
   - `FASTENDPOINTS_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Complete guide
   - `FASTENDPOINTS_COMPARISON.md` - Side-by-side comparison
   - `README.FastEndpoints.md` - Heroes feature docs

3. **Migrate Other Features**
   - Use the Heroes implementation as a template
   - Create `*FastEndpoint.cs` files for Teams feature
   - Follow the same patterns

4. **Customize**
   - Adjust route prefixes
   - Add custom processors
   - Configure additional features
